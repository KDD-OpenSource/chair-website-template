Our research and teaching activities aim at data mining and database technologies for multimedia and spatio-temporal databases in engineering, communication and life science applications. The huge amount of data as well as the complexity of  individual objects are limiting factors for analysis and exploration of real data sets. We face these challenges by developing new effective and efficient concepts for data analysis and data handling.
